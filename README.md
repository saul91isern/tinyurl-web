# tinyurl-web

Front end for our tiny url application.

## Development:

We need yarn to install and launch the app in development mode.

Start the react application

   * Install dependencies `yarn`
   * Test application `yarn test`
   * Run `yarn start`

Backend api host is declared in the .env file. If you prefer to change the domain on which the API is deployed beware of changing the host in this file.
By default, the web application is launched in port 3000 in development mode. [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

## Production:

We need to install docker and docker compose to run the app in production mode.
There is a `ci/` folder simulating the existing stages in a ci pipeline:

To run your Application:

   * Export needed variables: run `source ci/env.sh` in project root. Feel free to change any of the variables within the file 
  to adapt the installation to your needs.
   * Build the application `docker-compose run --rm build` in project root. It builds the static files under a `build` folder in the root directory.
   * Test with `docker-compose run --rm test` in project root.
   * Service `docker-compose run --rm --service-ports service` in project root. It runs the static files under `serve` in port 5000. [`localhost:5000`](http://localhost:5000)

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
